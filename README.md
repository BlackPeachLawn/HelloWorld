Todaynight, I saw a football game between China and Japan. I felt bad, so bad. 
So , I recalled the History and a saying: "少年强则国强”.
I made up my mind to be strong .so that the people of my country will be strong.
Lastly: Some words to the futher- NEVER ALSO CHOSE ANYI ,BEAT YOURSELF ALL THE TIME.
THIS IS A BEGINING , AND IS JUST A BEGINING .
